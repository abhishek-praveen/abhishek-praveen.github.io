<!-- # Hello! -->

Hello all, I'm Abhishek, an avid learner of Cybersecurity who started exploring this field 4 years ago, and it has been a roller coaster ride since then. I primarily work in Web Security for the last couple of years and am I currently focusing on expanding my expertise in subsequent areas as well. I love to uncover vulnerabilities in websites and create content on the same.

This blog is a personal space where I will post about my learnings and reflections as I try to walk down the long path of Cybersecurity, one step at a time.

Feel free to connect with me on my socials if you'd like to discuss anythingâ€”or just want to say hi.
